- **Body**:
Kye Gomez @kyegomez is threatening to sue openAI unless he is paid $10 million dollars for the use of the word "swarm" despite lying about owning the trademark, which is owned by some other company https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=87278643&caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&caseType=DEFAULT&searchType=statusSearch

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/536dc976-a186-42a3-96d8-2af361e6c045)

He has previously also names quatted repositories named "sora" https://github.com/kyegomez/Sora, last year he was running bots to scrape microsoft bing image creator to re-serve requests against his own "unofficial" dalle3 API, and https://github.com/Agora-Lab-AI/Dalle3/blob/main/dalle3/dalle.py#L113, and has had numerous other complaints about name squatting see e.g. https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/issues/1182  https://github.com/pypi/support/issues/2928 https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15sq2v1/d_potential_scammer_on_github_stealing_work_of/

He also ran a cryptocurrency scheme, purporting to pay people who contribute software services with crypto currency, sweepstakes scams pretending to give away A100s, statements that his company would be worth 100 trillion dollars by 2030, fake environmental carbon credit real estate holding company (before he got into AI). 

I would very much appreciate it if someone from OpenAI's legal department, would reach out to the Maimi-Dade district attorney's office, to refer him for prosecution, because I am tired of the blight he continually brings to open source.

- **Body**:
How does this differ from **Assistant API** , except for the fact that : 
- you have to manage and store conversation history manually.
- you cannot use the **file search** tool.
- you cannot use the **code interpreter** tool.

[[ In That Assistant api you are allowed to use the same thread **(conversation)** with Multiple Assistant ( **Agent**) , just specify the desired Assistant Id when creating a new Run ( **Completion**)]]

- **Body**:
**Dear Authors,**

Thank you for sharing your work. Appreciate your contribution to the field. I’d like to bring your attention to a project that seems closely related to your research, which was released about 8 months prior to yours.

**Project:** [https://gptswarm.org/](https://gptswarm.org/)  
**Code:** [https://github.com/metauto-ai/GPTSwarm](https://github.com/metauto-ai/GPTSwarm)  
**Paper:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16823](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16823) (ICML 2024, Oral Presentation)

Additionally, I would personally suggest considering GPTSwarm's approach of **(1) constructing agents as graphs**. From there, you could focus on **(2) improving the swarm intelligence by improving these graphs, either through reinforcement learning or automated prompt improvement**, as outlined in our paper.

In my experience, I believe this might be a visible and promising solution for LLM-based swarm intelligence (or MAS).

Best regards,  
Mingchen

🐝 **GPTSwarm is a graph-based framework for LLM-based agents, providing two high-level features:**

* It lets you build LLM-based agents from graphs.
